# Encryption-and-Decryption-of-Images
## Simple browser based application where images can be securely and quickly encrypted and decrypted in 2 simple steps :

#### Step 1: By default it will be in the **encrypt a file**, and since this is a key-based encryption algorithm, enter the key/password(min length of 8). 
#### Now, select the image file you want to encrypt either selecting from the drive/file or by drag-dropping into the grid-box area.

#### Step 2: For decrypting, select the **decrypt the file** button and re-enter the key you have create before in order to decrypt it
